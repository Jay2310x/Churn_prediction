# Churn Prediction In Telecom using Logistic Regression

CodeClause Internship Program
Tasks/Projects List:

 		1.Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry using Logistic Regression
<br>
A Telecom company is losing Customers to its competitors. With the historical customer churn information that they have, they want a ML Model to predict, which of their present customers may churn.
We have decided to create a Logistic Regression model to solve the problem. The Logistic Regression model will be expected to output a Churn Probability for every data under test.

The input data is spread over 3 separate files - churn_data.csv, cust_data.csv and internet_data.csv.

The Data includes the following:

Personal Data (gender, children, whether senior citizen, dependents...)
Services Related (Tenure with the provider, payment method, internet packs purchased, special offers...)
Charges being incurred (Amount of recharge done per month...)

		2.Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm
<br>
Huge retailers pivot on a detailed market basket analysis to uncover associations between items. Using this valuable information, they are able to carry out various strategies to improve their revenue:
-Associated products are placed close to each other, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.
-Discounts can be applied to only one of the associated products.

Data scientists are able to carry out Market Basket Analysis by implementing Association Rule Mining. Association Rule Mining is a rule-based machine learning method that helps to uncover meaningful correlations between different products according to their co-occurrence in a data set.
There are three core measures that are used in Association Rule Learning, which are: Support, Confidence, and Lift.
